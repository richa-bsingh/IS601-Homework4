## Notes on Advanced Calculator
The advanced calculator in part 3 contains static methods on the Calculator, instance methods on the Calculation, and class methods on the Calculations class.  In addition, it has more advanced testing that uses parameterized test data and a fixture to make it easy to setup each test with consistent data.  There are also modifciations to the .pylintrc file to control pylint's code analysis.

## Calculator functions are listed below:

1.  Operations (add subtract, multiply, divide).
2.  Exception throwing and testing on divide by zero.
3.  Use of static, class, and instance methods correctly.
4.  Has a calculation class that stores the arthitmentic operation in a instance property.
5.  Has a calculation history to store calculation instances.
6.  Has the convenience methods on the calculations class to manage the history.
7.  Use parameterized test data.
